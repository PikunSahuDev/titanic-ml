# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project uses Python, pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to predict whether passengers survived the Titanic disaster based on available features.

## 📊 Features Used:
- Passenger Class (pclass)
- Sex (encoded)
- Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (sibsp)
- Number of parents/children aboard (parch)
- Fare

## ⚙️ Libraries:
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## ✅ Model:
Logistic Regression  
Accuracy: ~78–82% (varies slightly)

## 📈 Visualizations:
- Confusion matrix
- Survival rate by gender

## 🧠 What I Learned:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and encoding
- Training a machine learning model
- Evaluating accuracy and confusion matrix

## 🚀 How to Run:
1. Clone the repo
2. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
3. Run `titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
